inu — Internet Navigation Utility - 犬
---
This is a browser extension I'm developing that provides additional navigational features to the Chrome.

Bookmarks are dead. My primary goal with this application is to create an alternative system for saving pages on the internet, a system that provides a better experience than the default bookmark tool in the following ways:
* Tagging support
* Page groupings, sequences, and chronology in browsing sessions using history and page transition types.
* Visual/spatial navigation of related pages through linktree and semantic visualization.

Just getting started.
